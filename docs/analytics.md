## Overview

The workflow analytics and reporting system provides comprehensive insights into your JIRA workflow performance through:

- **Cycle Time Analysis**: Measure how long issues spend in active development
- **Lead Time Analysis**: Track total time from issue creation to completion
- **Throughput Metrics**: Monitor delivery rate and trends
- **Flow Efficiency**: Understand the ratio of active work to wait time
- **Defect Rate Tracking**: Monitor quality metrics
- **Automated Recommendations**: Get actionable insights for improvement

## Analytics Features

### Cycle Time Analysis

Cycle time measures the duration an issue spends in active work states (e.g., from "In Progress" to "Done").

**Key Metrics:**
- Median cycle time
- Average cycle time
- 85th and 95th percentiles
- Min/max values
- Issue count

**Grouping Options:**
- By assignee
- By issue type
- By priority
- By component

### Lead Time Analysis

Lead time measures the total duration from issue creation to completion, including queue time.

**Key Metrics:**
- Median lead time
- Average lead time
- Percentile distributions
- Trend analysis

### Throughput Analysis

Throughput measures the rate at which issues are completed over time.

**Features:**
- Daily, weekly, or monthly intervals
- Trend analysis (increasing/decreasing/stable)
- Timeline visualization
- Grouped analysis

### Additional Metrics

- **Work in Progress (WIP)**: Current and historical WIP levels
- **Flow Efficiency**: Percentage of time spent in active work vs. waiting
- **Defect Rate**: Percentage of issues that are bugs or defects

## Reporting Features

### Report Formats

The system supports multiple output formats:

1. **JSON**: Structured data for programmatic use
2. **CSV**: Tabular data for spreadsheet analysis
3. **Markdown**: Human-readable reports with formatting
4. **HTML**: Rich formatted reports with styling

### Dashboard Generation

Create comprehensive dashboards for multiple projects:

- Multi-project overview
- Configurable time ranges (7d, 30d, 90d, 180d, 1y)
- Interactive HTML dashboards
- Metric comparisons across projects

### Data Export

Export detailed issue data with analytics:

- Issue-level metrics
- Status history
- Customizable field selection
- Multiple format support

## CLI Usage

## Examples

### Basic Analytics Example

```typescript
import { JiraRestClient } from './http/JiraRestClient.js';
import { WorkflowAnalytics } from './tools/workflowAnalytics.js';

const client = new JiraRestClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://your-domain.atlassian.net',
  email: 'your-email@example.com',
  apiToken: 'your-api-token'
});

const analytics = new WorkflowAnalytics(client);

// Generate comprehensive analytics
const result = await analytics.generateWorkflowAnalytics({
  jql: 'project = "MYPROJ" AND resolved >= -30d',
  groupBy: 'assignee'
});

console.log('Cycle Time Median:', result.summary.cycleTime.median);
console.log('Recommendations:', result.recommendations);
```

### Report Generation Example

```typescript
import { WorkflowReporting } from './tools/workflowReporting.js';

const reporting = new WorkflowReporting(client);

// Generate HTML report
const report = await reporting.generateReport({
  jql: 'project = "MYPROJ" AND resolved >= -90d',
  format: 'html',
  outputPath: './reports/quarterly-report.html',
  startDate: '2024-01-01',
  endDate: '2024-03-31',
  includeRecommendations: true
});

console.log('Report saved to:', report.reportPath);
```

### Dashboard Example

```typescript
// Generate multi-project dashboard
const dashboard = await reporting.generateDashboard({
  projects: ['PROJ1', 'PROJ2', 'PROJ3'],
  timeRange: '30d',
  metrics: ['cycleTime', 'leadTime', 'throughput'],
  outputPath: './dashboards'
});

console.log('Dashboard saved to:', dashboard.dashboardPath);
```

## Best Practices

### Data Collection

1. **Use appropriate time ranges**: 
   - For cycle time: 30-90 days of resolved issues
   - For trends: 3-6 months of data
   - For comparisons: Consistent time periods

2. **Filter data appropriately**:
   - Exclude test issues and spikes
   - Focus on production work
   - Consider issue types separately

3. **Group analysis meaningfully**:
   - By team (assignee)
   - By work type (issue type)
   - By priority for SLA analysis

### Interpretation Guidelines

1. **Cycle Time**:
   - Focus on median over average (less affected by outliers)
   - Investigate 95th percentile outliers
   - Look for patterns in grouped data

2. **Lead Time**:
   - Compare with cycle time to identify queue time
   - Monitor trends over time
   - Set realistic expectations based on historical data

3. **Throughput**:
   - Use for capacity planning
   - Monitor trends for process improvements
   - Consider seasonal variations

### Reporting Best Practices

1. **Regular Reporting**:
   - Weekly team reports
   - Monthly management dashboards
   - Quarterly trend analysis

2. **Actionable Insights**:
   - Focus on recommendations
   - Identify specific improvement areas
   - Track progress over time

3. **Stakeholder Communication**:
   - Use appropriate formats for audience
   - Provide context and explanations
   - Include improvement actions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Data Returned
**Symptoms**: Analytics return zero issues or empty metrics

**Solutions**:
1. Verify JQL syntax and permissions
2. Check date ranges and filters
3. Ensure issues have required status transitions
4. Verify project access permissions

#### Incorrect Cycle Time Calculations
**Symptoms**: Unexpected cycle time values

**Solutions**:
1. Verify start/end status names match exactly
2. Check for custom workflows with different status names
3. Review issue changelog for missing transitions
4. Consider timezone differences

#### Performance Issues
**Symptoms**: Slow analytics generation

**Solutions**:
1. Limit JQL results with appropriate filters
2. Use shorter date ranges for initial analysis
3. Consider pagination for large datasets
4. Optimize JQL queries

#### Report Generation Failures
**Symptoms**: Reports fail to generate or save

**Solutions**:
1. Check file system permissions
2. Verify output directory exists
3. Ensure sufficient disk space
4. Check for file path length limits

### Error Messages

#### "Failed to calculate cycle time"
- Check JQL syntax
- Verify issue access permissions
- Ensure issues have status history

#### "Invalid date format"
- Use YYYY-MM-DD format for dates
- Ensure start date is before end date
- Check for valid date values

#### "Unsupported format"
- Use supported formats: json, csv, markdown, html
- Check format parameter spelling

### Performance Optimization

1. **JQL Optimization**:
   - Use indexed fields in filters
   - Limit results with date ranges
   - Avoid complex nested queries

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Process data in batches
   - Use appropriate grouping levels
   - Cache results when possible

3. **Report Generation**:
   - Generate reports during off-peak hours
   - Use appropriate output formats
   - Consider report size limitations

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Metrics

You can extend the analytics system with custom metrics:

```typescript
// Example: Custom metric calculation
class CustomAnalytics extends WorkflowAnalytics {
  async calculateCustomMetric(jql: string) {
    const issues = await this.fetchIssuesWithHistory(jql);
    // Custom calculation logic
    return customMetrics;
  }
}
```

### Integration with External Systems

The analytics data can be integrated with external systems:

```typescript
// Example: Export to external dashboard
const analyticsData = await analytics.generateWorkflowAnalytics({
  jql: 'project = "MYPROJ"'
});

// Send to external system
await externalDashboard.updateMetrics(analyticsData.summary);
```

### Automated Reporting

Set up automated reporting with scheduled tasks:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Daily analytics report
jira-workflow analytics -j "project = MYPROJ AND resolved >= -1d" > daily-report.txt

# Weekly dashboard update
jira-workflow dashboard -p "PROJ1,PROJ2" -t "7d" -o "./weekly-dashboards"
```

This completes the comprehensive documentation for the workflow analytics and reporting features.
